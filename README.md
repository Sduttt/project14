# Assignment 14
13th August 2022
## Full Stack Javascript Web Development Course by [iNeuron](https://ineuron.ai/)

This webpage is created with HTML and CSS only. It is a mobile responsive webpage and I used media query to make it responsive. It took me almost 6 hours to complete this project. This project helped me to learn planning for designing web page, editing svg images. Images and icons are collected from [icons8](https://icons8.com/) and [iNeuron](https://ineuron.ai/).
